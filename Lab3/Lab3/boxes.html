    <!-- This is the canvas - the only HTML element that can render WebGL 
         graphics. You can have more than one WebGL canvas on a web page, but
         that gets tricky. Stick to one per page for now. -->
    <canvas id="gl-canvas" width="512" height="512">
        Oops ... your browser doesn't support the HTML5 canvas element
    </canvas>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1. Comment out the lookAt() call and replace it with a translate() with parameters ( 0, 0, -10 )
            Is there any change in the display? Why? Why not?
            <p>Nothing changed, because the location where 'perspective camera' points is the same place as the lookAt().</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Comment out both the lookAt() and translate() lines. What happens? Why?
            <p>Can't see anything but the black canvas. The 'perspective camera' is in the object so we can't see anything.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Take a look at the perspective() call. The aspect ratio you were originally given was 1.0.
            <p>What happens when the aspect ratio is 1.0 and you change the canvas dimensions in boxes.html to width="512" height="256" ?</p>
            <p>&emsp;The object in the canvas is squished vertically.</p>
            <p>How about width="256" height="512" ?</p>
            <p>&emsp;The object in the canvas is squished horizontally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            10.Rotate everything (using modeling transformations NOT lookAt) so that you are looking down at the top of the boxes and seeing the blue z-axis (and no red y-axis).
            <br/>If you wanted to leave your x and y axes unchanged, but still see the top of the boxes,
            <br/>how would you change your code?
            <p>Instead of putting:</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
                mv=mult(mv,translate( 0, 0, -10 ));
                <br/>mv = mult(mv, rotateX(90));
            </p> 
            <p>before creating the axis line representation, add it before creating the cube objects like: </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
                //10. Rotate everything including the X, Y and Z axis and objects 
                <br/>//mv=mult(mv,translate( 0, 0, -10 ));
                <br/>//mv = mult(mv, rotateX(90));
                <br/>
                <br/>gl.uniformMatrix4fv(mvLoc, gl.TRUE, flatten(transpose(mv)));
                <br/>gl.drawArrays(shapes.axes.type, shapes.axes.start, shapes.axes.size);	
                <br/>
                <br/>//10. Rotate the two objects only not the X, Y and Z axis
                <br/>mv=mult(mv,translate( 0, 0, -10 ));
                <br/>mv = mult(mv, rotateX(90));
                <br/>
                <br/>//code for adding objects goes here
            </p>    
        
        
        </li>
    </ul>
